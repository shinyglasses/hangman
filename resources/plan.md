# The Plan:
1. __Code UI first__
   - start screen, game screen (make it look good, find assets)
   - hold off on the save/load screen.
2. __Get the gameplay loop functional__
   - Put words in words.json
   - Have the amount of letters correspond to the # of _ on the screen
   - Allow the user input letters
      - If correct, show the letter in the correct position on the screen
      - If not correct, add a limb to the hangman
# Maybes:
1. Different difficulties
    - Maybe rarer words or less allowed guesses
2. Maybe a jumpscare with faces of different people appearing on the circle head
