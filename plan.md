# The plan!!

1. A word list (Nelson, json)
  - Randomly pick a word from the word list
2. End screen (Nelson)
  - You lose!!
  - return to the start
3. Start screen
  - Manual to play
  - any other information
4. Black and white color scheme 
5.  The game screen
  - A bar where the user can put their letter 
    - only allows them to put one
    - enter to submit
  - The man (Crystal)
  - The function(s) to add limbs (6)
  - The under score thing 
    - The number of underscores = length of word
  - A box to keep track of wrong words
  - Optimal sizing of list of letters
